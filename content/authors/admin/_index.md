Hi! I'm Wei-Tse Hsu, a Ph.D researcher in the [Shirts Research Group](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/shirtsgroup/) at CU Boulder. I'm passionate about unriddling biophysical phenomena from their relevant conformational ensembles obtained from molecular dynamics. I have abundant experience in various advanced sampling methods (e.g metadynamics, replica exchange, expanded ensemble, and umbrella sampling) I'm also working on SCALE-MS, a framework for supporting adaptive and asynchronous executions of simulation ensembles. I love transferring knowledge in any forms that make difficult things easier and inspiring. Being a professor is my career goal. In my free time, I enjoy long-distance running, cooking and playing the guitar.
