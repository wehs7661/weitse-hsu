Hi! I'm Wei-Tse Hsu, a Ph.D student in the [Shirts Research Group](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/shirtsgroup/) at CU Boulder. I'm passionate about unriddling biophysical phenomena from their relevant conformational ensembles obtained from molecular dynamics. I have abundant experience in various advanced sampling methods, including metadynamics, replica exchange, expanded ensemble, umbrella sampling and their most popular variations. I'm also working on SCALE-MS, an extensible framework for supporting adaptive and asynchronous executions of simulation ensembles. In parallel to my research, I love transferring knowledge in any form that makes difficult things easier and inspiring. Being a professor is my career goal. In my free time, I enjoy long-distance running and playing the guitar.
